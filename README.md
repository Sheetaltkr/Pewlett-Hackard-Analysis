## Summary 


1. **How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?**

	- **90398** retiring roles would need to be filled on priority basis for the upcoming mass retirement. **1549** retiring employees would re-hired for part-time mentoring role.So total **91,947** roles would be filled if we consider mentorship program hiring in addition to upcoming open positions. This estimate would change as per the re-hired employee count changes. 
	
	- This count can be reduced post by implementing performance enhancements to being down daily man/woman-hours. Re-assessment of the Tasks, organization re-structuring or vendor outsourcing can also help bring down the number of roles to be filled..

2. **Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?**

	- No, there aren't enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees considering the new joinees would be **> 90K** and mentors would be **< 1600**. 
	- PH will have to hire more mentors or change the mentorship criteria to include more of their retiring employees.
